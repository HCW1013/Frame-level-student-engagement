# Frame-level-student-engagement
Video based real life student engagement classification using knowledge transfer concept

##Executive summary
This project focuses on developing a robust student engagement detection system by leveraging facial features and video datasets. The main contributions include the introduction of a novel labeling methodology that captures the temporal dynamics of engagement within video frames, a comparative analysis highlighting the advantages of video datasets over image datasets in capturing engagement variations, and a comprehensive evaluation of all 712 facial features generated by OpenFace. The project aims to advance the field of student engagement detection and support educators in understanding students' levels of attention and interest. The GitHub repository provides the necessary resources for further research and collaboration in this domain.
